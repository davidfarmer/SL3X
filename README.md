This project is in the process of converting from python2 to python3.

Not yet ready to be used.

The Python program sl3x.py (Structured LaTeX to XML) converts math papers
and books in LaTeX into HTML or MBX.

Put all the Python files into the same directory and then run

./sl3x inputfile outputdirectory -t xxx

where xxx is html or ptx.

The outputdirectory will be created if it doesn't already exist.
The index.xxx file in the outputdirectory is the starting point.
You will have to be online so that the necessary
CSS and Javascript files are available.
